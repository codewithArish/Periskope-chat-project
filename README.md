# Periskope Chat Project

Welcome to the **Periskope Chat Project** repository! This is a real-time chat application built using Next.js with TypeScript, Supabase, and Tailwind CSS. The project demonstrates modern web development practices and real-time database interaction.

While I used AI tools to assist with some parts, the major development, coding, and architecture were done by me personally, ensuring a clean, efficient, and scalable codebase.

## How I Built This Project

1. **Planning & UI Design:**
   - Outlined the main features and user flows.
   - Designed the interface with responsiveness and simplicity in mind.
   - Used Tailwind CSS for rapid and consistent styling.

2. **Frontend Development:**
   - Built the UI components with Next.js and TypeScript for scalability and type safety.
   - Implemented the chat interface, user lists, and message input areas.
   - Used React hooks and context API for state management.

3. **Backend & Real-time Functionality:**
   - Leveraged Supabaseâ€™s authentication system for secure user login/signup.
   - Used Supabaseâ€™s realtime database subscriptions to enable instant message updates.
   - Managed message storage and retrieval using Supabaseâ€™s PostgreSQL backend.

4. **AI Assistance:**
   - Used AI tools like ChatGPT to optimize code structure and get suggestions for improving certain functions.
   - Adapted and refined AI-generated code to maintain project-specific needs and standards.

5. **Testing & Debugging:**
   - Tested on multiple devices and browsers to ensure consistent behavior.
   - Fixed issues related to synchronization and UI responsiveness.

6. **Deployment:**
   - Deployed the project on Vercel for seamless hosting and global CDN.
   - Continuous monitoring and planned improvements based on user feedback.
